/**
<p>The Cardinal-spline passes through the points in the control-path specified by the group-iterator.
However, the curve does not pass through the first or the last control-point, it begins at the
second control-point and ends at the second last control-point.

<p>There is a single parameter, alpha, that gives some control over the shape of the curve.  When
the value of alpha is 0.5 the curve becomes the CatmullRomSpline.  Figure 1 shows an example of a
CardinalSpline.
